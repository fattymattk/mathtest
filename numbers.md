# Numbers

It might seem silly to talk about what numbers are. We've been dealing with them since we were children, and we have a pretty good idea of what they are.

But just to make sure we're all speaking the same language, let's make some definitions.

>Definition:
>
>The **natural numbers**, denoted by $\mathbb{N}$, are simply the "counting" numbers: $0,1,2,3,4,5,...$ and so on.

Note that it's not uncommon to exnclude $0$ in the definition. Don't worry too much about this, either definition is okay as long as one is clear about what they mean.

We can add any two natural numbers together and get back another natural number. For example, if we add $5$ to $3$, we get $3+5=8$, and $8$ is also a natural number. We can also multiply any two natural numbers together and get back another natural number: $7\cdot6 = 42$, and $42$ is a perfectly acceptable natural number.

However, it's not true that we can always subtract a natural number from another to get back another natural numbers. If we subtract $5$ from $3$, we get... well, we actually can't do that! But that brings us to our next number system.

>Definition:
>
>The **integers**, denoted by $\mathbb{Z}$, are the natural numbers and their negative values: $...-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,...$.

The integers also have the property that we can add or multiply any two together and get back another. But the integers also have the property that we can subtract any integer from another, and get back another integer. For example, if we subtract $5$ from $3$, we get $3-5=-2$.

What we can't do though, is divide any two integers and get back another integer. Sometimes we can: for example, $6$ divided by $3$ is $6/3 =2$. But in general, we're not guaranteed another integer: we cannot divide $5$ by $3$, for example.
