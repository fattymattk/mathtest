# Power Rule

Computing derivatives using the limit definition can be tedious and time-consuming. We therefore want to find rules that can apply to different situations so we don't have to use the limit definition over and over again.

The first rule we'll consider is the **power rule**. This applies to functions in the form $f(x) = x^n$ where $n$ is a positive integer. (Actually, it also applies when $n$ is real, but for now we'll only consider when $n$ is a positive integer.)

We can first use the Binomial Theorem to expand out $(x+h)^n$.

$$
(x+h)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} x^k h^{n-k}. 
$$

Then

$$
\frac{(x+h)^n-x^n}{h} = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{n}{k} x^k h^{n-k-1}. 
$$

Taking the limit as $h \rightarrow 0$, the only terms left in the sum are when $n-k-1=0$. This leaves us with

$$
\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{(x+h)^n-x^n}{h} = \binom{n}{n-1} x^{n-1} = n x^{n-1}. 
$$

That's the power rule. If $f(x) = x^n$, then $f'(x) = n x^{n-1}$. This is true for all $x$ in the domain of $f$.

For example, if $f(x) = x^{10}$, then $f'(x) = 10x^9$. The slope of the tangent line to the graph of $y=x^{10}$ is $10x^9$.
