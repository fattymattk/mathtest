# Functions

Roughly speaking, a function is a thing that takes an element of a set and maps it to an element in a different set. We write $f: A \rightarrow B$ to mean the following:

$f$ is a function that maps elements in set $A$ to elements in set $B$. If $x$ is in $A$, then we can think of $x$ as an input for the function. We write $f(x)$ to be the output of the function $f$ when the input is $x$. If $y=f(x)$ for some $x$ in $A$, then we require $y$ to be in set $B$.

We call $A$ the **domain** of $f$. We call $B$ the **codomain** of $f$.

We will only be interested in functions that have real numbers as inputs and outputs. Hence, $A$ and $B$ will always be subsets of $\mathbb{R}$.

> **Definition:**
>
>A **function** $f: A \rightarrow B$ is a rule that assigns to each element $x \in A$ exactly one element in $B$.

We should note that "exactly one element" means that an input $x$ cannot have two different output values. That is, if $f(x) = y$ and $f(x) = z$, then $y = z$. For this reason, there is never any ambiguity by what we mean by $f(x)$. It only has one value!

It's unfortunately common to refer to $f(x)$ as a function. While we have no choice but to excuse such behaviour, we can still point it out as incorrect. $f$ is a function. $f(x)$ is the value of the function when the input is $x$. Simply put, $f$ is a rule or a formula, and $f(x) is a number. These are very different things!
