# Product Rule

Taking the derivative of a sum or difference of functions is straightforward and intuitive. We have that $(f+g)' = f' + g'$ and $(f-g)' = f' - g'$. We might then be tempted to think that the same idea applies to the product of functions: i.e. that $(fg)' = f'g'$.

But this is wrong!

As an example, if $f(x) = x^2$, then we know that $f'(x) = 2x$. But we can also write $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$ where $g(x)=h(x) =x$. Under the naive idea above, we'd have that $f'(x) = g'(x)h'(x) = 1$. So clearly this idea is wrong.
